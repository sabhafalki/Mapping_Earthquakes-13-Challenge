# Mapping_Earthquakes-13-Challenge
## Overview of Project ##
The purpose of this Project is to create earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay.The data containes tectonic plates location on the earth, and all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map.

## Resources ##
- Data Source: PB2002_boundaries.json,majorAirports.json,torontoNeighborhoods.json,torontoRoutes.json.
- Libraries/Dependencies: D3.js,GeoJSON,Mapbox API.
- Software: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code,Leaflet.

## Results ##
